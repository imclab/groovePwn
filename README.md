**FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY**

A minimal proxy which will remove ads and snatch MP3s from Grooveshark and store
them in an organised manner while you use the site as-per-usual.

To run:

1. From your chosen download directory run
   python proxy.py
2. Instruct your web browser to use localhost port 8080 as a proxy
3. Use grooveshark as per usual and observe the MP3s being placed nicely into
   your current directory!

Obviously I cannot condone the use of this software and it is naturally not
intended for any use beyond education study. I highly recommend you don't use
it.
